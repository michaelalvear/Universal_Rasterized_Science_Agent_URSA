Summary:
This project aims to create an AI agent to act as a natural language
interface for querying and analyzing raster GIS data generated by the Biscayne
and Southern Everglades Coastal Transport (BISECT) Model (Swain et al., 2019),
addressing critical accessibility concerns for climate data in the South
Florida region. The proposed method is applicable generally to rasterized
climate data (NetCDF).
